              <h3>Read or watch chapter 7 of Search Inside Yourself, and reflect:</h3>

              <h3 class="">Q: Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: My favourite technique at the moment is just to take time to hear about another person's day over a coffee. It makes both parties feel valued and helps to create a bond. </div>

              <h3 class="">Q: Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: I still think the most fundamental change in my work relationships came from empathetic listening, where I devoted my full focus and attention on to what the other party was saying without interjecting, and then fed back or affirmed what they said. That in of itself opened the door to the other person being interested in my own life and better bonds forming. </div>

              <h3 class="">Q: How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: I think it's great a similar concept to that proposed in another book I recently read. In that book the concept was that where there was a person who was seen as a bully or antagonist, that I needed to do things ie kindness, that got myself 'out of the box', in thinking they were just something in my way, rather than another person just like me. The end result of recognising that the other person was just as much a person as I was did help alot in allowing me to still treat that person respectfully even though at times they really didn't deserve that, ie it meant that I had the choice not to engage in the same negative behaviour. </div>

              <h3 class="">Q: Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: While recognising the value in this exercise, I think some of the issues I recently faced in work might be a bit sensitive for this forum! </div>

              <h3 class="">Q: Any other musings?
              </h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: I think at this time I'd rate myself as still working through how my relationships with other individuals work, and haven't extended myself to thinking about how skilled I am at reading the political or emotional undercurrents of an organisation - hopefully this comes with experience! </div>
