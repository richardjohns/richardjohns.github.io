    <h1>Reflections on Shereef's Fireside Chat</h1>

        <div class="panel-heading">
          <h2 class="panel-title"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right" aria-hidden="true" style="padding-right:5px"></i>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>My take is that overall dev academy is very much about what we make of it and how we bring others along in our journey. If we want to transform our lives and careers, the aim if to strap an apron on and get working with others in the kitchen no matter what their level, and take responsibility for our own experience, the experiences of those we team up with, and the end product we present to others.</p>

          <p>It confirms that the bootcamp is meant to be a fairly intense 9-week experience, and an opportunity to mix and learn with others that I wouldn't normally have access to.</p>

      <div class="panel panel-default">
        <div class="panel-heading">
          <h2 class="panel-title"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right" aria-hidden="true" style="padding-right:5px"></i>What are your impressions?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>My impressions are that people come to bootcamp have a real opportunity in front of them & are motivated to learn. The primary issue is to get out of thinking that things will be handed to you and that everyone else is responsible for your experience. In terms of gaining knowledge, the aim is to get a handle on the higher level principles as to how to programe and build things in teams, rather than to get down to the 'bricklayer' level ie building using ruby, javascript etc, as the libraries used may change but the principles to build or programme don't.</p>

          <h2 class="panel-title"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right" aria-hidden="true" style="padding-right:5px"></i>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>I see myself as needing to be quite welcoming and socially proactive, and open about my level so not being afraid to ask for help. On the other hand looking out for those in my group who need help is necessary too as we're all in it together.</p>

          <h2 class="panel-title"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right" aria-hidden="true" style="padding-right:5px"></i>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Yes, the talked has changed my understanding of the course - just fulfilling the course requirements week-to-week isn't enough. It confirms that my work needs to be focussed on a goal such as my own websites or projects, or to help with those of others. Contributing to the wider community is also important but my time available is scarce with still working and all.</p>

      <div class="panel panel-default">
        <div class="panel-heading">
          <h2 class="panel-title"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right" aria-hidden="true" style="padding-right:5px"></i>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Overall am excited. The talk addressed one of the principle fears I had regarding my own level in relation to others. Shereef emphasised humility in that no matter how advanced a student might think they are, that compared to the instructors they were quite likely to be just in the early stages of their webdev journey, the same as everyone else. To be part of an environment where it's emphasised that we're all in it together and just starting out is an exciting thing.</p>
