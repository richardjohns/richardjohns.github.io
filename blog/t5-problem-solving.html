              <h3>As if talking to a non-tech friend, tell a story about a time you:</h3>
              <h3 class="">1. Got blocked on a simple problem</h3>
              <h3 class="">Q: What was the problem?</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: In this case I was having trouble with a loop exercise and couldn't figure out why the loop wasn't adding to the variable. </div>
              <h3 class="">Q:  What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: Mainly I used psuedocode. I went for a walk and on the way back home with a coffee I realised why my variable wasn't increasing in value... it was due to me having placed the variable above the function (ie in the global scope). As a result the function loop kept grabbing the global variable, adding it then dropping it and starting from scratch each time. I put the variable inside the function and used a parameter then it started working... phew.</div>
              <h3 class="">Q: How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: Generally really frustrated but curious - alot of satisfaction when the code came right. </div>
              <h3 class="">Q:  What did you learn?</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: It was a simple example of scope chain that I learned from the hard way! </div>
              <br>
              <h3 class="">2. Solved a problem in an elegant way</h3>
              <h3 class="">Q: What was the problem?</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: I had problems with the chessboard idea and was unable to get an alternating pattern to console.log. </div>
              <h3 class="">Q:  What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: Again I mainly used psuedocoding to visualise a solution. I realised I could cheat by running the two types of lines (eg # first or space first) by running a nested loop formula (ie 4 inner loops and 4 outer loops).</div>
              <h3 class="">Q: How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: I knew it wasn't a perfect answer but frankly I was relieved that I had something I could use and progress with. I was pleased with at least having an answer. </div>
              <h3 class="">Q:  What did you learn?</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: I learned from the answer that the author's code was pretty complex - wasn't sure I knew enough about js to come up with that at my level. I did it my own way and produced a little thing I was proud of - though superficial! </div>
              <br>
              <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and processes:</h3>
              <h3 class="">Psuedocode</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: This one is kinda essential I feel! Trying to visualise the path to solving a problem at a high level, or by dwelling on it. I'm fairly confident with this but not necessarily with coding problems.</div>
              <h3 class="">Trying something</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: I'm fairly confident with this step but will need to develop in this as I don't have a lot of tools at my disposal in order to solve a problem at the moment but this will change,</div>
              <h3 class="">Rubber-ducky method</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: I like this method, but often I find that talking the problem through with another person is just as effective and bit more rewarding so I go do that!</div>
              <h3 class="">Reading error messages</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: I'm starting to see that these are useful... at least for picking up basics like broken paths, undefined variables, missing brackets! </div>
              <h3 class="">Console.logging</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: I like this approach for console.logging i on loops as the output shows you each step the loop takes for a quick debug. </div>
              <h3 class="">Googling</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: Naturally really confident on this - well trained by life I guess.</div>
              <h3 class="">Asking your peers for help</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: I'm getting better at this as I'm firing a few questions at Callum for instance when I get stuck as he seems to be further ahead.</div>
              <h3 class="">Asking coaches for help</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: I think I'm confident with asking coaches - perhaps too confident! It's tempting to go straight to the coach as they'll give you the best answer in the quickest time.</div>
              <h3 class="">Improving your process with reflection</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: I'm not too confident on using reflection as a problem solving tool but I'll keep at it!</div>

              <h3>Using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words:</h3>
              <h3 class="">.map()</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: Ja </div>
              <h3 class="">.filter()</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: When a function is run over an array, this array method is used to create a new array for every instance of the subject array for which the function returns true. </div>
              <h3 class="">.reduce()</h3>
              <div class="sample-text">A: Ja </div>
